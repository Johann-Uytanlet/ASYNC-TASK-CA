This is a Sandpile Model Simulation. Please press the play button and it will automatically add 1 into the middle of the 13 by 13 grid.
Each cell can hold up to three pieces of sand. Therefore there are only four states a cell can be in, 0 - blue, 1 - green, 2 - yellow, 3 - orange. Once a cell holds more than three pieces it would spread to the four adjacent cells.
